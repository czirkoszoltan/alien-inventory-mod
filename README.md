Recreating the images:

Sources:
- UP*.png are from [https://www.ufopaedia.org/](https://www.ufopaedia.org/)
- Unitsmasks.png file is from [ufo2000](http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/) and GPL'ed

How to:
- Run the shell script, which creates the 24-bit color inventory images (you need imagemagick)
- Open gimp, paste each image into bspalette.gif to apply the correct battlescape palette
- Now you have the 8-bit images with the correct colors & nice color quantization of gimp
